# create-Hello-World
First of Firsts, steps in building my git repositories portfolio

Following the step by step guide as I am/is/was a virgin nerd. I will now learn git 
Editing my first branch, I commited my first branch

Hopefully soon I'll be able to do this all without reading a guide! :) 
then I'll run a pull-request.
